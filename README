The application iterates over a set of questions getting input from
the user using a specified visual scale format. Such formats include
analog, binary, and digital. Configurable options may be accessed
through the applications preferences using the menu, or with the
keystroke command-comma. Currently configurable options include task
name, data directory, data file name, question set file, question set
access method as well as general behavior such as run on start.
